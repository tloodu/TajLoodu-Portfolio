# TajLoodu-Portfolio
A personal site with basic information about me for employers, or anyone who stumbles across it. It is also an oppurtunity for me to experiment more with Git and design methodologies! It is currently a work in progress that I hope to complete by December 2020! Below is how to download the project and run it locally to see my progress!

# Install

This is assuming you have node.js installed globally

First we need to make sure the Gatsby Cli is installed

```sh
npm install --global gatsby-cli
```
Then you can run it by:
```sh
cd TajLoodu-Portfolio
cd tajloodu-site
gatsby develop
```
